Exercise id 0005 from acmp.ru

The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains the only number N - the number of elements of the integers array (1 <= N <= 100).
The second line contents N numbers, representing this array. Each array element is an integer between 1 and 31 inclusively. 
All array elements are divided with space.

The first line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT must content odd numbers from the array, and the second line must content even numbers. 
All numbers should be written in the same order as they were written in the input file, and be divided by space.
In the third line should be written "YES" if there is more of even numbers then odd numbers, or if there is the same number of them.
Otherwise, there should be written "NO".
